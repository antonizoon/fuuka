Fuuka
-------

Fuuka is a program that that lets you archive 4chan imageboards.

It's written in Perl. It uses MySQL for its local database, CGI or
mod_perl if you want a web interface and gnuplot to create graphs with
statistics.

Check the wiki articles at http://code.google.com/p/fuuka/w/list for the system
requirements and advanced tips on how to run it.
